# TryHackMe Challenge Report Summary

Welcome to the TryHackMe Challenge Report Summary! This document serves as an overview of my participation and key learnings from four different TryHackMe challenges, each focusing on a specific cybersecurity tool.

The purpose of this report is to demonstrate an understanding of these tools and their application in various cybersecurity scenarios. The challenges completed are as follows:

1. **Nmap** - Network scanning and enumeration
2. **Burp Suite** - Web application security testing
3. **SQLMap** - Automated SQL injection and database takeover
4. **Metasploit** - Exploitation framework for penetration tests

Below you will find a brief summary of each challenge, along with a direct link to the respective rooms on TryHackMe for more detailed exploration.

## üåê Nmap Challenge
[Nmap Challenge Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap)

In this challenge, I leveraged Nmap to conduct network reconnaissance, identifying active machines, open ports, and running services. I practiced a variety of scanning techniques, including stealth and aggressive scans, and learned to interpret the results to spot potential vulnerabilities.

## üïµÔ∏è Burp Suite Challenge

Burp Suite proved to be an invaluable tool for web security testing. During this challenge, I configured and used Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses. I also explored its various components such as the Intruder and Repeater to carry out attacks and analyze web applications.

## üõ°Ô∏è SQLMap Challenge
[SQLMap Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/sqlmap)

SQLMap automated the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws. Throughout this challenge, I focused on using SQLMap to not only detect SQL injection points but also to extract database information, demonstrating the tool's power in database server takeovers.

## üéØ Metasploit Challenge
[Metasploit Intro Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitintro)

Metasploit was used to exploit vulnerabilities found in systems. I learned to search and select the appropriate exploit, configure and launch it against a target, and use payloads to gain control over a system, all while maintaining stealth.
