# TryHackMe Challenge Report Summary

Welcome to the TryHackMe Challenge Report Summary! This document serves as an overview of my participation and key learnings from four different TryHackMe challenges, each focusing on a specific cybersecurity tool.

The purpose of this report is to demonstrate an understanding of these tools and their application in various cybersecurity scenarios. The challenges completed are as follows:

1. **Nmap** - Network scanning and enumeration
2. **Burp Suite** - Web application security testing
3. **SQLMap** - Automated SQL injection and database takeover
4. **Metasploit** - Exploitation framework for penetration tests

Below you will find a brief summary of each challenge, along with a direct link to the respective rooms on TryHackMe for more detailed exploration.
